## Things you will need
### Hardware
* Arduino UNO
* 1x GAL20V8 PLD IC
* 1x 470 Ohm resistor
* 1x 1K Ohm resistor
* Programmer for the GAL20V8. The popular TL866 works well
### Software
* The Arduino IDE
* WinCupl (only if you want to change the GAL20V8 pin assignments)
* MiniPro Programmer software (in the case of the TL866)

## The circuit

## Programming the GAL20V8
* I have included the <a href="https://github.com/dadecoza/arduino-mpf1-vdp/tree/main/Files">.JED</a> file that you can write to the PLD for use with the circuit above.
* You can use WinCupl if you want to change the pinouts or use a different PLD.

## Loading the Arduino sketch
* I have included my <a href="https://github.com/dadecoza/arduino-mpf1-vdp/tree/main/Arduino">Arduino directory</a>, you will have to copy the contents to your own sketchbook directory.
* I have also included a patched copy of the TVOut library with some added features (ie. cursor position, invert text, mirror text ...).
## Usage
You have probably noticed that only 4 bits of the 8-bit bus on the Z80 are connected to the PLD and from the PLD to the Arduino.

This means we will have to send the byte nibble for nibble at a time.

We also need to warn the Arduino VDP that we are about to send a byte and we do this by first sending 0xF and only then sending the two nibbles (first high, then low).

The following subroutine will do the needed work to write a byte to the Arduino VDP ...
```asm
VDP     PUSH    BC              ; start of VDP subroutine ... copy BC to the stack for save keeping
        LD      (VDPB), A       ; store the byte to display in memory
        LD      C, 0xC0         ; C contains the IO address for the VDP
        LD      A, 0xFF         ; load 0xFF into the accumulator
        OUT     (C), A          ; Write the 0xFF to the VDP indicating that the high nibble of the byte will follow 
        LD      B, 50           ; load 50 into the B register for a delay loop
VDPD1   DJNZ    VDPD1           ; do the delay loop so that the VDP microcontroller has some time to do its thing
        LD      A, (VDPB)       ; load the byte we want to load back into the accumulator 
        RRA                     ; rotate right ... we want to get to the high nibble
        RRA                     ; rotate some more
        RRA                     ; and again
        RRA                     ; yay we made it
        OUT     (C), A          ; write the high nibble to the VDP
        LD      B, 50           ; again with the delay loop ... that microcontroller is running at 16mhz!
VDPD2   DJNZ    VDPD2           ; loopy loop
        LD      A, (VDPB)       ; load the original byte we want to display back into the A register
        LD      B, $0F          ; bitmask to get rid of the high nibble leaving only the lower
        AND     B               ; apply the bitmask to the accumulator
        OUT     (C), A          ; write the low nibble to the VDP
        LD      B, 200          ; final delay loop ... if we weren't so lazy we could have implementedd an ACK signal
VDPD3   DJNZ    VDPD3           ; last loopy loop
        POP     BC              ; recover BC
        RET                     ; return from subroutine
```
